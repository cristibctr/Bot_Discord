            <title>What are class and object in C++</title>
            <description>A class is a user-defined data type that has data members and member functions. Data members are the data variables and member functions are the functions that are used to perform operations on these variables. An object is an instance of a class. Since a class is a user-defined data type so an object can also be called a variable of that data type.</description>

            <title>What is polymorphism in C++?</title>

            <title>Explain constructor in C++</title>
            <description>The constructor is a member function that is executed automatically whenever an object is created. Constructors have the same name as the class of which they are members so that compiler knows that the member function is a constructor. And no return type is used for constructors. </description>
